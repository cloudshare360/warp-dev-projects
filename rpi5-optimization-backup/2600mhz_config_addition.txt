# Advanced Overclocking Settings
force_turbo=1                    # Always run at maximum frequency
temp_limit=80                    # Temperature limit based on good cooling
initial_turbo=0                  # Disable turbo timeout
avoid_warnings=1                 # Bypass overclocking warnings

# Enhanced Memory Configuration  
sdram_freq=3600                  # High-speed RAM
over_voltage_sdram=6             # RAM voltage boost
