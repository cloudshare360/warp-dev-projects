- **Secondary Actions**: Subtle styling, supporting the primary flow
- **Information Architecture**: Clear grouping and categorization
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show relevant information contextually

### 3. Color Scheme
- **Primary Blue** (#007bff): Primary actions, links, active states
- **Success Green** (#28a745): Completion, success messages
- **Warning Yellow** (#ffc107): Cautions, pending states
- **Danger Red** (#dc3545): Errors, deletions, critical actions
- **Neutral Grays** (#f8f9fa to #333): Backgrounds, borders, text

### 4. Typography
- **Primary Font**: Arial/Helvetica (system fonts)
- **Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headings and body text
- **Readability**: Adequate contrast ratios and font sizes
- **Responsive Text**: Scalable typography for different screen sizes

### 5. Spacing & Layout
- **8px Grid System**: Consistent spacing multiples
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: Mobile-first approach
- **Content Areas**: Clear boundaries and grouping
- **White Space**: Adequate breathing room between elements

## Design Decisions & Rationale

### 1. Modal-based Todo Creation
**Decision**: Use modals instead of inline forms
**Rationale**: 
- Maintains context while providing focused editing space
- Reduces page navigation and improves workflow
- Allows for complex forms without cluttering the main interface

### 2. Sidebar Navigation
**Decision**: Persistent sidebar for main navigation
**Rationale**:
- Quick access to different views and categories
- Clear visual hierarchy and organization
- Familiar pattern for productivity applications

### 3. Color-coded Priorities
**Decision**: Visual indicators for priority levels
**Rationale**:
- Immediate visual recognition of important tasks
- Reduces cognitive load when scanning task lists
- Standard pattern users expect in task management apps

### 4. Admin Panel Separation
**Decision**: Distinct admin interface with different styling
**Rationale**:
- Clear separation of concerns and user roles
- Prevents accidental admin actions by regular users
- Allows for specialized admin functionality and layouts

### 5. Responsive-first Design
**Decision**: Mobile-first responsive design approach
**Rationale**:
- Ensures functionality across all device types
- Improves performance on mobile devices
- Future-proofs the application for various screen sizes

## Conclusion

This design specification provides a comprehensive foundation for implementing the Todo App with both user and admin functionality. The wireframes and documentation serve as a blueprint for development, ensuring consistency and completeness across all features.

The modular approach allows for iterative development while maintaining a clear vision of the final product. Regular reviews and updates to this specification should be conducted as development progresses and user feedback is incorporated.
